# Contributing

Tanya is a project in active development, therefore any help is appreciated. Thank you for considering contributing
to it, feel welcome.
These guidelines describe ways to get started.


## Ways to get involved

* **Reporting a problem**: [Report](https://issues.caraus.io/projects/tanya/issues) bugs and usage problems you
encounter.
* **Fixing issues**: [The bug tracker](https://issues.caraus.io/projects/tanya/issues) contains a list of issues you
can work on.
* **Documentation**: You can improve API documentation by correcting grammar errors, completing existing texts and
writing new ones, or providing usage examples.
* **Testing**: Test coverage is important for a library. Writing tests is not only helpful, but is also a great way
to get a feel for how tanya works.


## Opening an issue

If you have found a bug, an error, have some question, or suggestion, open in issue. Tanya uses an external
[bug tracker](https://issues.caraus.io/projects/tanya/issues). You should
[register](https://issues.caraus.io/account/register) before you can report your issue. There is also a list
of open issues that mirror the current development process and progress. If you're looking for a challenge, just
pick an issue you are interested in and start working on it. Fill free to comment on the issue to get more
information.

Some issues have a category assigned to it. Such issues belongs mostly to a larger part of the library that is
currently in development. The category specifies then the git branch development happens on. The remaining issues
can be fixed directly in master.

In the [roadmap](https://issues.caraus.io/projects/tanya/roadmap) you can find a list of issues that are planned
to be fixed till a specific release. Version numbers refer to the versions in the
[git repository](https://github.com/caraus-ecms/tanya/releases).


## Creating a pull request

I accept GitHub pull requests. Creating a pull request is like sending a patch with a suggested change.
First you have to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository. Clone your fork locally
with `git clone` and create a new branch where you want to work, for example:

```shell
git checkout -b bugfix-x
```
Commit your changes to your fork:

```shell
git commit -m "Fix Bug X"
git push -u origin bugfix-x
```
After that if you visit your fork on GitHub, GitHub will suggest to create pull request. Just follow the steps
described on GitHub to finish the process.

Please ensure that you fork is even with the upstream (original) repository. If not, you have to rebase your branch
on upstream master before submitting a pull request. See https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/ for a
step-by-step guide.
