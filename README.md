# This repository is abandoned

Please note that this repository is now abandoned. I'm currently working on merging the code into
[dlib](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib).

This repository will be kept alive for some time for reference purpose and as a sandbox for new features.

# D event loop

tanya's mission was to provide a GC-free, general purpose library for D programming language for developing servers.
Since dlib follows similar rules I decided that it would be better to extend and improve an existing library.
Dlib has some features like containers I can build on without developing everything by myself.
